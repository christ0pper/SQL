# Employee Management SQL Project

This project demonstrates my hands-on experience with SQL for the **Cognizant certification**.  
It includes database design, table creation, data manipulation, joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and views.

## 🧩 Database Overview

**Tables:**
- `Departments`
- `Employees`
- `Projects`
- `Employee_Project`

**Features implemented:**
- Primary and Foreign Keys  
- Constraints (`CHECK`, `NOT NULL`)  
- Joins and Subqueries  
- Aggregate functions (AVG, GROUP BY)  
- View creation (`EmployeeSummary`)

## 💻 How to Run
1. Copy the code from `employee_management.sql`
2. Run it in MySQL Workbench / PostgreSQL / SQL Server
3. Execute the queries at the bottom to view results

## 📊 Sample Output Queries
- Average salary by department
